BungeeCord for 1.7/1.8/1.9/1.10/1.11/1.12/1.13/1.14/1.15/1.16
==========

**Fork:** [BungeeCord](https://github.com/SpigotMC/BungeeCord) >> [HexaCord](https://github.com/HexagonMC/BungeeCord) >> [KettleCord](https://github.com/UeberallGebannt/KettleCord/)

**What's HexaCord?**</br>
HexaCord reimplements Minecraft 1.7.10 and basic 1.7.10 Forge support.</br>
It also works better when using [Magma](https://magmafoundation.org/), [Thermos](https://github.com/CyberdyneCC/Thermos) and other hybrid servers.</br>
If you want more informations about it, please visit it's github page [here](https://github.com/HexagonMC/BungeeCord).

**What's KettleCord?**</br>
KettleCord is a fork of HexaCord with some little changes for our Minecraft network KettleMC.net.</br>
It's also planned to implement some security checks, but that's still a long way off.

### Security warning

As your Minecraft servers have to run without authentication (online-mode=false) for BungeeCord to work, this poses a new security risk. Users may connect to your servers directly, under any username they wish to use. The kick "If you wish to use IP forwarding, please enable it in your BungeeCord config as well!" does not protect your Spigot servers.

To combat this, you need to restrict access to these servers for example with a firewall (please see [firewall guide](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/firewall-guide/)) or a plugin like [PreventPortBypass](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/preventportbypass-the-onlyproxyjoin-alternative.54934/).
