==========
This project is now archived because updating became more and more annoying and since I don't depend on BungeeCord anymore, I will stop developing this fork.

Thank you to everyone who used this project! It was very fun while it lasted. If you want an alternative, check out [Waterfall](https://github.com/PaperMC/Waterfall) or use [Velocity](velocitypowered.com/) instead of BungeeCord.

**Edit:** As of 27.06.2022 the HexagonMC team announced that HexaCord is abandoned. Due to this announcement, HexaCord was replaced with Waterfall in the recommendations.

BungeeCord for 1.7/1.8/1.9/1.10/1.11/1.12/1.13/1.14/1.15/1.16/1.17
==========

**Fork:** [BungeeCord](https://github.com/SpigotMC/BungeeCord) >> [HexaCord](https://github.com/HexagonMC/BungeeCord) >> [KettleCord](https://github.com/UeberallGebannt/KettleCord/)

**What's HexaCord?**</br>
HexaCord reimplements Minecraft 1.7.10 and basic 1.7.10 Forge support.</br>
It also works better when using [Magma](https://magmafoundation.org/), [Thermos](https://github.com/CyberdyneCC/Thermos) and other hybrid servers.</br>
If you want more informations about it, please visit it's github page [here](https://github.com/HexagonMC/BungeeCord).

**What's KettleCord?**</br>
KettleCord is a fork of HexaCord with some little changes for our Minecraft network KettleMC.net.</br>
We implemented some patches from [Waterfall](https://github.com/PaperMC/Waterfall/) in order to patch some forge issues.

### Security warning

As your Minecraft servers have to run without authentication (online-mode=false) for BungeeCord to work, this poses a new security risk. Users may connect to your servers directly, under any username they wish to use. The kick "If you wish to use IP forwarding, please enable it in your BungeeCord config as well!" does not protect your Spigot servers.

To combat this, you need to restrict access to these servers for example with a firewall (please see [firewall guide](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/firewall-guide/)) or a plugin like [PreventPortBypass](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/preventportbypass-the-onlyproxyjoin-alternative.54934/).
